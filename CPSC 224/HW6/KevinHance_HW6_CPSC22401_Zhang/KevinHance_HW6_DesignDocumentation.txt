Programming Assignment #6 (Yahtzee)

This program model the foundation for the creation of a playable Lizard-Spock-Yahtzee game. So far, the program allows
the user to roll the dice as many times as is specified in "maxRolls", choosing which dice they want to keep after each
roll. Following the last roll, a list of scores will be outputted to the console. These will show the user how many points
they can earn buy choosing to score in any of the 13+ possible rows on the Yahtzee scoreboard. The user can then pick any
row they haven't already used to score, and the game continues until all rows have been filled.

The design for my program was focused around breaking the problem up into different classes: Scoreboard,
Hand, Die, and Yahtzee, which contains the main method. Breaking the problem down into different classes
made the program significantly less redundant and easier to read. In addition, using Collections.sort instead
of Bubble Sort reduces runtime in terms of worst case big-O measurements. As I built more of this program, I
quickly learned that I should have split up class functions differently to reduce clutter in the main method.

I ran into numerous FileNotFoundException and NoSuchElementExceptions when dealing with the configuration from a text file.
I also ran into a few issues regarding static methods using non-static variables.. Other than that, nothing major impeded
me on this assignment.

If I had more time, I would have done far more testing and optimizing to ensure this game runs correctly for dice with
more than 6 values and for hands of more than 5 dice.
