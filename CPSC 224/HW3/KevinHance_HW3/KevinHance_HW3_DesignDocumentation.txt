Programming Assignment #3 (Container)

This program creates an array full of integers in "data.txt". Integers i and j are indexes
of 2 different elements in the array. Then, using the integers in the array at elements i and
j, the program finds the maximum container size (height * width). Height is defined as the
minimum of the two values being compared. Width is defined as j minus i. After trying every
possible combination of i, j, ai, and aj where i < j, the program will output the maximum
container area using the algorithm described above.

The design for my program was quite simple. First, the program goes through the data file once
to find the number of elements, which is used as the size for array initialization. Then, the file
is traversed once more to populate the array with integers. If the array contains at least two
elements, the MaximumContainer function is called. This function uses a nested for-loop to find
every possible combination of i, j, ai, and aj where i < j. After trying each combo and comparing
the area with the maximum area found thus far, the program will output the maximum container area
using the algorithm described in the first paragraph.

Initially, I was running into an odd runtime error that caused the program to find one string,
but no integers, in the data.txt file. After some troubleshooting, I realized that I had initialized
the Scanner by passing in the String "data.txt", instead of passing in new File("data.txt"). Once I
fixed this careless mistake, I had no further problems getting my program to work.

Because of the sheer simplicity of this program, I don't think there isn't much more that I could do
to noticeably improve the runtime or user interfance of this program.
