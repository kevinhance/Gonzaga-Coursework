* Programming Assignment #1 (Anagram Check)
* @author Kevin Hance
* @version v1.0 1/25/18
*
* This program compares any two strings (consisting only of alphanumeric characters and spaces), then
* outputs whether or not the two strings are anagrams of each other. The program begins by prompting
* user for two strings, then converts them into character arrays, which allows us to compare the size
* and contents of the two strings in a simple and organized manner. If one of the two strings contains
* the character '!', the program quits and says "Goodbye".
*
* The design for my program was quite simple, as we only needed one helper function for simplicity.
* There is one class, AnagramCheck, which contains a main function and an isAnagram helper function,
* which takes in two strings and returns a boolean representing whether or not the two strings are
* anagrams of each other. If any non-alphanumeric characters (besides ! and spaces) are entered, the
* program may produce undesirable results.
* 
* Because of the sheer simplicity of this assignment, I did not run into any major design or
* programming issues.
*
* If I had more time, I'd have added functionality to ignore (or accurately take into account) any
* non-alphanumeric characters entered. I would also implement a more streamlined and user-friendly
* console interface. However, for the purposes of this assignment, I believe the algorithm and
* interface I implemented are sufficient.
