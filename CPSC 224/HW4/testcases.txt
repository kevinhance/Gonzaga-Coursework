HW Assignment #4 (Queue): Test Cases

	Because this assignment did not require capability for user input,
	I did all of my testing in the main method. Below is the code used
	to fill, display, and empty the two different kinds of Queues.

		PriorityQueue q = new PriorityQueue(10);
		q.enqueue(new Task("Eat your vegetables", 2));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Take the trash out", 1));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Go to work", 3));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Take the recycle out", 4));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Stop by Safeway", 5));
		q.dequeue();
		
		q.enqueue(new Task("Change oil in the Toyota", 6));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Update accounting software", 2));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Wash the dishes", 5));
		q.enqueue(new Task("Do CPEN pre-lab", 5));
		q.display();
		
		
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.display();
		
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.display();
		
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.display();
		
		q.dequeue();
		q.dequeue();
		q.display();
		
		System.out.println("\nNow that we've filled up and emptied the Priority Queue, we will test the normal Queue.");
		
		Queue q2 = new Queue(10);
		
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Take the trash out"));
		q2.display();
		
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Feed the fish"));
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Walk Brenda's dog"));
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Visit Jake at work"));
		q2.display();
		
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Fill car with gas"));
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Go to class"));
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Bring the garbage bin back up the driveway"));
		q2.display();
		
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Empty the dishwasher"));
		q2.enqueue(new Task("Make the bed in the guest room"));
		q2.display();
		
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.display();
		
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.display();
		
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.dequeue();
		q2.display();
		
	Below this is the console output from those functions. Notice that both
	the generic queue and the priority queue are asked to add a task when
	they're full and remove a task when they're empty. Both types of queues
	handle this by outputting a message to the console and not attempting to
	perform the action, to avoid crashing. In addition, if display() is called
	on an empty queue, a message is outputted to the console notifying the user
	that the queue is empty and nothing will be displayed.
