Programming Assignment #5 (Yahtzee)

@version v1.0 3/08/2018

This program model the foundation for the creation of a playable Yahtzee game. So far, the program allows
the user to roll the dice up to 3 times, choosing which dice they want to keep after each roll. Following
the third roll, a list of scores will be outputted to the console. These will show the user how many points
they can earn buy choosing to score in any of the 13 possible rows on the Yahtzee scoreboard.

The design for my program was focused around breaking the problem up into different classes: Scoreboard,
Hand, Die, and Yahtzee, which contains the main method. Breaking the problem down into different classes
made the program significantly less redundant and easier to read. In addition, using Collections.sort instead
of Bubble Sort reduces runtime in terms of worst case big-O measurements.

I ran into very few errors or strategic roadblocks while writing this program, such as ArrayOutOfBounds
exceptions caused by easily diagnosable off-by-one errors. With that said, the most tedious portion of the
assignment was definitely the conversion from C++ to Java.

If I had more time, I would have implemented exceptions to stop the program from crashing when given faulty
input.
